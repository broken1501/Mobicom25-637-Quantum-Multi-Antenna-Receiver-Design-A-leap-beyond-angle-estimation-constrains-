# Mobicom25-637-Artifact-README

Our code is developed based on MATLAB, version R2023a.\

In order for the code to run correctly, you need to unzip the five files in the “data” folder and move the unzipped txt files to the top-level subdirectory of the “data” folder.

Then you can run the artifact we submitted by simply clicking the Run button in MATLAB.\
The toolbox and version listed in the toolbox.md file are required to run the program.
